    "This is an implementation of the objective function and constraints detailed [here](https://github.com/xuanamylin/divvy-bike-rebalancing/blob/master/Divvy%20Rebalancing%20Solution%20-%20Math.ipynb). The model is set up in Julia with JuMP and solved using the Gurobi commercial solver. For the sake of demonstration, we crafted a solution to re-balance traffic of 29 Divvy stations. The route was mapped onto the Chicago map by Wei Grace Yin to illustrate how it works in action."
